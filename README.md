Hi! I'm a current sophomore computer science student at Bergen Community College. I'm looking to transfer into a four year school after the upcoming semester. I have already taken courses in Data Structures & Algorithms (using C++), Object Oriented Programming (in Java), and Databases (using Oracle SQL Server).

I have a keen interest in the world of mobile computing as it is definitely the future of computer use as we know it. As technology becomes more and more integrated into our daily lives, computers will play a bigger and bigger role in making our lives easier, our items smarter, and our surroundings better. I want to be a part of this change and hopefully make an impact in any way I can.

Outside of computer sciences, I also love to play the guitar, I enjoy playing tennis, and I also am enthralled by all things car related, especially race track driving.
